            The domestic dog is a domesticated descendant of the wolf.
             The dog derived from an ancient, extinct wolf,and the modern grey wolf is the dog's nearest living relative.
             The dog was the first species to be domesticated,
            by hunterâ€“gatherers over 15,000 years ago,
            before the development of agriculture. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The dog has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors,
             sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.
             Dog breeds vary widely in shape, size, and color.
             They perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection,
              assisting police and the military, companionship, therapy, and aiding disabled people.
             This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of "man's best friend."

        <p>
            There is a controversy about the earliest historical period in which dogs were domesticated.
            Some studies suggest that dogs were domesticated  about 15,000 years ago
            and some identify the remains of domesticated dog bones in Europe more than 33,000 years ago. 
        </p>
        <P>
            There is also a school that holds that domestic dogs are not wolves, but wild dogs,
            which were an intermediate stage between the domestic dog and the wolf.

        <P>
            A working and service dog is a dog that is used as a working animal , and not just as a pet .
            The term "working and service dogs" is used in three main meanings:
        </P>
        <P>
        <ul><li>
                Dogs that perform specific tasks that help humans in their work,
                whatever their breed. Thus, for example, grazing dogs ,
                which help to collect and walk herds of sheep and cattle.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul><li>
                Dogs belonging to defined breeds, which are nurtured thanks to the unique characteristics of the breed,
                which allow it to perform various work tasks.
                Thus, for example, the Border Collie breed has a strong grazing instinct.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul><li>
                Dog breeds with a specific purpose, 
                whose original purpose was to perform human service tasks,
                but are no longer used for these tasks.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1><code>Dog's health</code></h1>
        <p>
            Some breeds of dogs are prone to specific genetic ailments such as elbow
            and hip dysplasia, blindness, deafness, pulmonic stenosis, cleft palate, and trick knees.
            Two severe medical conditions significantly affecting dogs are pyometra, affecting unspayed females of all breeds and ages,
            and Gastric dilatation volvulus, which affects larger breeds or deep-chested dogs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Both of these are acute conditions and can kill rapidly.
            Dogs are also susceptible to parasites such as fleas, ticks, mites, hookworms, tapeworms, roundworms, and heartworms,
            which is a roundworm species that lives in the hearts of dogs.
